Once you ssh into the Cloudlab profile run the following commands:  

sudo docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

apt-get update

apt-get upgrade

apt-get install redis-server

redis-server

Now you want to leave that terminal open and open a new terminal and ssh back into the head node. Once you are sshd back in run
the following commands:  

docker exec -it (containters name) bash
redis-cli ping (Response should be pong)

redis-benchmark

In order to test different aspects of the benchmark you need to know the additions to the command.

-n 10 changes the number of requests sent to the server to be 10

-c 5 changes the number of parallel clients to be 5

-d 100 Changes the bytes of payload sent to be 100 per command

redis-benchmark -n 10 -c 5 -d 100 
This would be the full command to run with the additions to it. This would test the benchmark with the given restrictions.
