We plan on implementing this by using Docker.

Benchmarks:  

1) Redis
  The goal is to create a server using Docker and measure the latency and increase the efficiency 
  of it. This cloud-based server is used for caching, storing session information, and maintain 
  hot unstructured data sets.
  
2) Memory Bandwidth - Stream
  The goal for this is to implement Docker in a CloudLab profile to measure the rate at which data can be read. 
  Our goal is to reach the standards set on the paper for Docker. 
  
3) Random Memory Access - RandomAccess
  Random Memory Access works to focus on random memory performance. It takes a large section of memory for its 
  working set that is larger than any caches or buffers. Random 8 byte words are then read, modified, and written back. 
  The random qualities come from using linear feedback shift registers that do not require any memory operations. 
  Random Memory Access strives to have large working sets with minimal computation. 
  
4) CPU - PXZ
  The goal of this benchmark is to measure and accelerate the speed it takes to compress a file. And increase the efficiency of compressing a file.
