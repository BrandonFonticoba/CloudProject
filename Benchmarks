We plan on implementing this by using Docker.

Benchmarks:  

1) Redis
  The goal is to create a server using Docker or Redis and measure the latency and increase the efficiency 
  of it. This cloud-based server is used for caching, storing session information, and maintain 
  hot unstructured data sets.
2) Memory Bandwidth - Stream
  
3) Random Memory Access - RandomAccess
  
4) CPU - PXZ
  The goal of this benchmark is to measure and accelerate the speed it takes to compress a file. And increase the efficiency of compressing a file.
