We are doing the Performance Evaluation Project. Our task is to select four benchmarks from the paper "An Updated Performance Comparison of Virual Machines and Linux Containers" and try to implement them on different hardware on CloudLab. Our goal is to be able to automatically install KVM, Docker, or Singularity on a single CloudLab profile. Able to automate the installation and configuration of our selected benchmarks and run them. Lastly, to be able to automate the entire process within a single CloudLab profile and instantiate/collect at least 20 runs.
